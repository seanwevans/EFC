We propose a cosmological framework in which spacetime, gravity, and cosmic 
dynamics emerge from the evolution of a fundamental informational entropy field
S(t, v). Unlike models that assume spacetime as primary, we treat entropy as 
the fundamental substance from which geometric structure arises. We derive an 
Informational Einstein Equation connecting curvature directly to second 
covariant derivatives of S, and show how this framework reduces to Special 
Relativity, General Relativity, Thermodynamics, and Quantum Mechanics in 
appropriate limits. The model predicts subtle deviations from Î›CDM, including 
specific signatures in cosmic expansion and structure formation, offering 
falsifiable predictions for surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST. We 
conclude with a roadmap for empirical validation and theoretical refinement.
